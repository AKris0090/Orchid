## ðŸŽ¯ My goals for this project

### PBR Textures
|                                                     Base Color                                                  |                                                     Normal                                                                    |

I implemented the Cook-Torrence BRDF with reference from: https://learnopengl.com/PBR/Theory. My loader implemntation searches for essential textures: albedo, normal, metallic/roughness, ambient occlusion, and emission. If one is not found, a default texture is used. 

### Image-Based Lighting
|                                      Warm Skybox                         |                     Cool Skybox                                          |
| :----------------------------------------------------------------------: | :----------------------------------------------------------------------: |
|                   ![](README_IMAGES/IBL/blaze.png)                       |                    ![](README_IMAGES/IBL/sky.png)                        |

The ambient lighting is driven by the chosen skybox images. Two cubemaps are generated:

1. Irradiance Cubemap for diffuse lighting.
2. Prefiltered Environment Cubemap for specular reflections, filtered by roughness.

Each cubemap is generated with offscreen render passes.

### Shadow Mapping / Cascaded Shadow Mapping

|                              Shadow Map Slices              |          Final Output                                 |

Cascaded Shadow Mapping (CSM) splits the cameraâ€™s view frustum into smaller sections, allowing detailed shadows close to the camera while reducing detail farther away. This technique solves shadow quality issues in scenes with distant light sources.

### Animations / Compute skinning

GLTF files have the ability to store bone data and skinning information, and the gltf loader library I use (tinygltf) has a way to access these. I felt it was beneficial to have the vertex data be of the same format as the other static objects (to reduce overall complicatedness at draw time), so I implemented a compute shader in order to modify the vertex buffer itself, which I then pass through a single rendering pipeline.

### Nvidia PhysX Implementation
I have set up a physics simulation that represents the actors in the scene, and by mapping the transform of the physics objects to the objects in my scene, I can represent physics interactions between them. I have also made use of the built-in character controller class, and plan to implement a third person camera.

## Current Venture
Third person camera using PhysX raycasting
